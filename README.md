# CATastrophe
You open the game.  
There's a catgirl.  

She doesn't talk.  
She doesn't move.  
She has no clue who you are.  

A game where you do literally nothing.  
And somehow, you can't stop.  

Why?  
We don't know either.  

## What is this?
*CATastrophe* is a interactive experience about curiosity, cats, and questions with no answers.  
You can click the catgirl. She probably won’t mind.  
Or maybe she will.  
You’ll have to see for yourself.  
The real mystery isn’t her. It’s why you’re still here.  

## How to Play?
- Download and launch the game on your platform.
- Click the catgirl.
- Repeat as desired.
- Wonder what you’re doing with your life.

## System Requirements
- Windows10/11 (if your toaster runs Unity games, it probably works)
- A working mouse, or just a finger if you’re on a touch device
- Screen, eyes, curiosity

## FAQ
Q: Is there an ending?  
A: Life is a journey, not a destination. (But maybe. Or maybe not.)  
Q: Can I mod the game?  
A: The catgirl prefers things just the way they are.
